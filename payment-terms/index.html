        <p>By using TNX Inc. (“RALY”) or subsidiaries (together with RALY collectively and individually according to context, “RALY,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) payment
            processing services (“Payment Services”), you agree to be bound by the General Terms
                of Use (“General Terms”) and these additional terms and conditions (“Payment Terms”). If you
            are using the Payment Services on behalf of a business, you agree that you accept all these terms and have
            authority to enter into these terms on behalf of that business. Payment Services may only be used for
            business purposes within the provinces and territories of Canada. Defined terms not otherwise defined
            herein will have the same meaning as those found in the General Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, RALY
            Canada processes all debit transactions on the Interac Network, and RALY, Inc. processes all other
            payment transactions.</p>

        <h4 id="payment-services">Payment Services</h4>

        <h5 id="our-role">1. Our Role</h5>

        <p>RALY is a payment facilitator that allows you to accept Cards from customers for the payment for goods and
            services. We are not a financial institution as defined in the Bank Act (Canada) and do not offer banking
            services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. RALY’s Payment Services allow you to accept payments from any Canadian issued and most non-Canadian
            issued credit, card-not-present debit, collectively, “Cards”) bearing the trademarks of the American Express Company, Inc. (“American
            Express”), Discover Financial Services, Inc. (“Discover”), JCB Co., Ltd., Mastercard Inc. (“MasterCard”)
            and Visa Inc. (“Visa”) (together with the Interac Association and its and their respective affiliates,
            collectively, the “Networks”). We may remove or add Cards that we accept at any time without prior notice.</p>

        <p>In order to serve in this role, we must enter into agreements with Networks, processors and acquiring banks.
            In some cases, the Networks require that any person that signs up for a RALY Account to use Payment
            Services (a “Seller”) and processes more than Network specified amounts of Card sales enter into an
            agreement directly with RALY’s acquiring bank. By accepting or otherwise agreeing to these Payment Terms,
            you agree to the terms and conditions of the “Commercial Entity Agreement”
            effective as of the date you process such specified amounts. If you fail to agree to the Commercial Entity
            Agreement, we may suspend or terminate your RALY Account. Similarly, if American Express considers you to
            be a high value customer, it may require that you maintain your agreement directly with American Express
            and designate RALY as your agent for American Express payments. If that is the case, we will notify you
            of such requirement.</p>

        <h5 id="your-authorization">2. Your Authorization</h5>

        <p>In connection with the Payment Services, you authorize us to act as your agent for the limited purposes of
            holding, receiving, and disbursing funds on your behalf. Your authorization permits us to generate a paper
            draft or an electronic funds transfer to settle the proceeds of each Card transaction that you authorize,
            less any applicable Fees (as defined in Section 4) (“Proceeds”). Your authorizations will remain in full
            force and effect until your RALY Account is closed or terminated. Our receipt of transaction funds
            satisfies your customer’s obligations to make payment to you. We will remit to you funds actually received
            by us on your behalf, less amounts owed to us, subject to any Chargeback (as defined in Section 18) or
            Reserve (as defined in Section 14) withheld or applied. This authorization also permits us to debit any of
            your linked bank accounts at any time for the purposes specified in these Payment Terms and the General
            Terms. You also agree to be bound by any applicable rules of Payments Canada.</p>

        <h5 id="prohibited-industries">3. Prohibited Industries</h5>

        <h5 id="our-fees">4. Our Fees</h5>

        <p>You agree to pay the applicable fees listed on our Fee
                Schedule (“Fees”) for use of the applicable Payment Services. All Fees are charged at the time we
            process a transaction and are deducted first from the transferred or collected funds and thereafter from
            the Balance (as defined in Section 15) in your RALY Account. Subject to the General Terms and these
            Payment Terms, we reserve the right to change our Fees upon ninety (90) days’ advance notice. You must
            agree to the change in Fees to continue to use the Payment Services. All Balances and all Fees, charges,
            and payments collected or paid through the Payment Services are denominated in Canadian dollars, unless
            otherwise specified.</p>

        <h5 id="processing-errors">5. Processing Errors</h5>

        <p>We will attempt to fix processing errors we discover. If the error resulted in your receipt of fewer funds
            than you were entitled, we will credit your RALY Account for the difference. If the error results in your
            receipt of more funds than you were entitled, RALY will debit the extra funds from your RALY Account or
            your linked bank account. You are responsible for monitoring your transactions and ensuring that our
            payments to you are correct. You must notify us of any errors in payments made to you within sixty (60)
            days of the error first appearing on your electronic transaction history. Failure to notify us of a
            processing error within sixty (60) days will be deemed a waiver of any right to amount applicable to the
            error. We will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if you notify us of such an error.</p>

            Canada, a Canadian citizen, or a business entity authorized to conduct business by the province(s) or
            territory(ies) in which you operate and that you are an authorized signatory for the business you
            represent. You must use your or your business’ true and accurate name when opening a RALY Account. This
            name will appear on the credit or debit card statements of your customers for all payments you accept using
            the Payment Services. If a transaction dispute results from your failure to use a reasonably descriptive
            user name, you agree to indemnify RALY for any costs stemming from such dispute.</p>

        <h5 id="underwriting-and-identity-verification">7. Underwriting and Identity Verification</h5>

            RALY to request identity verifying information about you, including, but not limited to, (a) a consumer
            and/or credit report that contains your name and address and may contain “credit information” such as age,
            occupation, place of residence, previous places of residence, marital status, spouse’s name and age, number
            of dependants, particulars of education or professional qualifications, places of employment, previous
            places of employment, estimated income, paying habits, outstanding debt obligations, cost of living
            obligations and assets and other personal information, and (b) to the extent applicable, a confirmation
            from the appropriate governmental authority of your corporation’s legal existence. RALY may periodically
            obtain additional reports to determine whether you continue to meet the requirements for a RALY Account.
            You permit RALY to share information about you and your application (including whether you are approved
            or declined), and your RALY Account with your bank or other financial institution, or as otherwise
            specified in the Privacy Policy. RALY or its processor and/or acquiring
            bank, which may or may not be located in Canada, may conclude that you will not be permitted to use the
            Payment Services.</p>

            Inspection</h5>

            invoices from your suppliers, a government issued identification such as a passport or driver’s license, a
            business license, or other information. RALY may also ask for permission to inspect your business
            location. If you refuse any of these requests, your RALY Account may be suspended or terminated.</p>

        <p>We will settle Proceeds to your verified bank account, subject to the payout schedule described in Section
            11. If RALY is not able to debit or credit the bank account you link to your RALY Account, that bank
            account will be de-linked from your RALY Account.</p>

        <h5 id="right-of-setoff">10. Right of Setoff</h5>

        <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you grant us a security interest in, as well as a right of setoff
            against, and assign, convey, deliver, pledge and transfer to us, as security for repayment of any
            obligations due under these Payment Terms, all of your right, title, and interest in and to all of your
            accounts with us. You authorize us, without prior notice to you and irrespective of (i) whether we have
            made demand under these Payment Terms or any other related agreements; and (ii) whether the obligation is
            contingent, matured or unmatured, to the extent permitted by law, to collect, charge, and/or setoff all
            sums owing on the indebtedness against any and all such accounts and other obligations, and our option, to
            administratively freeze or direct any third party bank holding the account to freeze all such accounts to
            allow us to protect our security interest, collection, charge and setoff rights as provided for in this
            section. For clarity, you agree that RALY Canada may setoff amounts owed against funds held or processed
            by RALY, Inc. and that RALY, Inc. may setoff amounts owed against funds held or processed by RALY
            Canada.</p>

        <h5 id="payout-schedule">11. Payout Schedule</h5>

        <p>RALY will automatically initiate a payout of Proceeds to your valid, linked Canadian bank account at the
            end of the business day. If you adjust your business’s close of day to a custom time, RALY will group
            Proceeds for the 24-hour period preceding your custom time and initiate a payout at the end of that
            business day. RALY will initiate a payout of Proceeds received on non-business days before the next
            business day.</p>

        <h5 id="availability-of-proceeds">12. Availability of Proceeds</h5>

        <p>We may defer payout or restrict access to your Proceeds if we need to conduct an investigation or resolve
            any pending dispute related to your use of the Services. We also may defer payout or restrict access to
            your Proceeds as necessary to comply with applicable law or court order, or if requested by any
            governmental entity.</p>

        <h5 id="RALY-account-history">13. RALY Account History</h5>

        <p>When a payment is made to your RALY Account, we will update your RALY Account activity on the website
            and provide you a transaction confirmation. The confirmation will serve as your receipt. Summaries of your
            RALY Account activity, including monthly statements, are available on our website for up to one year of
            account activity. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for (a) compiling and retaining
            permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your RALY Account and your use of
            the Payment Services, and (b) reconciling all transactional information that is associated with your RALY
            Account. If you believe that there is an error or unauthorized transaction activity is associated with your
            RALY Account, you must contact us immediately.</p>

        <h5 id="reserve-for-holding-funds">14. Reserve for Holding Funds</h5>

        <p>We may withhold funds by temporarily suspending or delaying payment of Proceeds to you and/or designate an
            amount of funds that you must maintain in your RALY Accounts or in a separate reserve account (a
            “Reserve”) to secure the performance of your obligations under any agreement between you and RALY. We may
            require a Reserve for any reason related to your use of the Services. The Reserve will be in an amount as
            reasonably determined by us to cover potential losses to RALY. The Reserve may be raised, reduced or
            removed at any time by RALY, in its sole discretion, based on your payment history, a credit review, the
            amount of any arbitration award or court judgment against you in RALY’s favor, or otherwise as RALY or
            its processor may determine or require. If you do not have sufficient funds in your Reserve, we may fund
            the Reserve from any funding source associated with your RALY Accounts, including any funds (a) deposited
            by you, (b) due to you, or (c) available in your bank account, or other payment instrument registered with
            us. Upon acceptance of these Payment Terms, you confirm that you have read, understood and accepted
            RALY’s <a href="/ca/legal/pad">Pre-Authorized Debit Agreement</a>. You agree to execute any additional
            documentation as may be required from time to time for us to debit your bank account as described in these
            Payment Terms. You grant us a security interest in and lien on any and all funds held in any Reserve, and
            also authorize us to make any withdrawals or debits from the Reserve or any bank account linked to any of
            your RALY Accounts, without prior notice to you, to collect amounts that you owe us. You will execute any
            additional documentation required for us to perfect our security interest in any funds in the Reserve. This
            security interest survives for as long as we hold funds in your Reserve.</p>

        <h5 id="RALY-account-balances">15. RALY Account Balances</h5>

        <p>While you have funds in your RALY Wallet (your “Balance”), your Balance will be co-mingled and held with
            other participants’ funds in one or more pooled accounts at one or more banks by us on your behalf and for
            the benefit of you and others holding balances (each a “Pooled Account”). We have sole discretion over the
            establishment and maintenance of any pooled account. We will not voluntarily make funds available to our
            creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose. You will not receive interest or any other
            earnings on any funds that we handle for you. As consideration for using the Payment Services, you
            irrevocably assign to us all rights and legal interests to any interest and/or other earnings that may
            accrue or are attributable to our holding of your Balance in a Pooled Account or Reserve.</p>

        <h5 id="our-set-off-rights">16. Our Set-off Rights</h5>

        <p>To the extent permitted by law, we may set off against the Balances for any obligation you owe us under any
            agreement with RALY (e.g., Chargebacks or refunds). If you owe us an amount that exceeds your Balance, we
            may charge or debit a payment instrument registered in your RALY Account or any connected RALY Account
            (as well as set off against any Balance in any connected RALY Account). Your failure to fully pay amounts
            that you owe us on demand will be a breach of these terms. You are liable for any of our costs associated
            with collection in addition to any amounts owed, including legal fees and expenses, and collection agency
            fees.</p>

        <h5 id="dormant-RALY-accounts">17. Dormant RALY Accounts</h5>

        <p>If you do not process payments through your RALY Account for an extended period of time or have not linked
            a valid bank account, you may have a Balance that is deemed “unclaimed” or “abandoned” under your
            province’s law. If this occurs, RALY will provide you with notice as required by applicable law and
            instructions for how to deposit your Balance. If funds still remain in your RALY Account, RALY will
            transfer such funds to the applicable provincial government as required by applicable law or, as permitted,
            to RALY.</p>

        <p>There may be times when your customer may not be the authorized user of the Card or your customer may
            otherwise contest the transaction. In these instances, the amount of a transaction may be reversed or
            charged back to your RALY Accounts (a “Chargeback”) if the transaction (a) is disputed, (b) is reversed
            for any reason by the Network, our processor, or a customer or its financial institution, (c) was not
            authorized or we have any reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, or (d) is allegedly
            unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of these terms. You agree to comply with the Chargeback process and
            to the liability associated with such Chargebacks.</p>

        <h5 id="our-collection-rights-for-chargebacks">19. Our Collection Rights for Chargebacks</h5>

        <p>For any transaction that results in a Chargeback, we may withhold the Chargeback amount in a Reserve. We may
            recoup the amount of any Chargeback and any associated Fees, fines, or penalties listed in the Fee Schedule
            or assessed by a Network or our processor from your RALY Accounts (including any Reserve), any proceeds
            due to you, or any bank account or other payment instrument linked to any of your RALY Accounts. If you
            have pending Chargebacks, we may delay payouts from your RALY Account. Further, if we reasonably believe
            that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential
            Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you until such time that: (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a
            customer complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or
            regulation by which your customer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a
            Chargeback on the transaction will not occur. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for
            which you are liable, you agree to pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. You
            agree to pay all costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred by us for the collection
            of all amounts unpaid by you.</p>

        <h5 id="excessive-chargebacks">20. Excessive Chargebacks</h5>

        <p>If we believe you might incur, or you are incurring, an excessive amount of Chargebacks, we may establish
            additional conditions governing your RALY Account, including (a) establishing new processing fees, (b)
            creating a Reserve in an amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks and related
            fees, (c) delaying payouts, or (d) terminating or suspending the Payment Services.</p>

        <h5 id="contesting-chargebacks">21. Contesting Chargebacks</h5>

        <p>You will assist us when requested, at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed
            through the Payment Services. To that end, you permit us to share information about a Chargeback with the
            customer, the customer’s financial institution, and your financial institution in order to investigate
            and/or mediate a Chargeback. We will request necessary information from you to contest the Chargeback. If
            the Chargeback is contested successfully, we will release corresponding reserved funds to your RALY
            Account. If a Chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the Network or issuing bank or you choose
            not to contest the Chargeback, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in
            these terms. You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a
            transaction, including providing necessary documentation within fifteen (15) days of our request, may
            result in an irreversible Chargeback. We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for
            mediating and/or investigating Chargeback disputes.</p>

            authorize or settle any transaction that you submit to us if we believe that the transaction is in
            violation of these terms or any other agreement with RALY, or that it exposes you, your customers, other
            RALY Sellers, our processors or RALY to harm. Harm includes fraud and other criminal acts. If we
            suspect that your RALY Account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give

            for collecting, withholding, reporting, and remitting correct Taxes to the appropriate tax authority. We

        <h5 id="refunds-and-returns">33. Refunds and Returns</h5>

        <p>By accepting Card transactions through the Payment Services, you agree to process returns of, and provide
            refunds and adjustments for, your goods or services through your RALY Account in accordance with these
            Payment Terms and Network Rules. Network Rules require that you disclose your return or cancellation policy
            to customers at the time of purchase. The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any associated taxes
            required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original sales data except
            by the exact amount required to reimburse the customer for postage that the customer paid to return
            merchandise. If your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the customer, you may still
            receive a Chargeback relating to such sales. You can process a refund through your RALY Account up to one
            hundred twenty (120) days from the day you accepted the payment. If you use RALY Online Store, you may
            not be able to process a partial refund. If your available RALY Balance is insufficient to cover the
            refund, RALY will withdraw up to the requested refund amount (the sale amount minus the initial
            transaction fee) from a payment instrument registered with your RALY Account or any connected RALY
            Account and credit it back into your customer’s Card. The Fees are also refunded by RALY, so the full
            purchase amount is always returned to your customer. RALY has no obligation to accept any returns of any
            of your goods or services on your behalf.</p>

        <h5 id="additional-indemnity">34. Additional Indemnity</h5>

        <p>In addition to Section 15 of the General Terms, you will indemnify, defend, and hold us and our processors
            (and our respective employees, directors, agents, affiliates and representatives) harmless from and against
            any and all claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments, Tax assessments, penalties, interest, and expenses
            (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of any claim, action, audit, investigation, inquiry, or other
            proceeding instituted by a person or entity that arises out of or relates to any transaction submitted by
            you through the Payment Services (including the accuracy of any content or product, service, or transaction
            information that you provide or any claim or dispute arising out of products or services offered or sold by
            you).</p>

            Services, you represent, warrant and covenant to us that: (a) the Card transaction represents a bona fide

            and regulations; (e) except in the ordinary course of business, you are not submitting a transaction that
            represents a sale to any principal, partner, proprietor, or owner of your entity; and (f) you are not
