Pre-Authorized Debit Agreement
Version: 1-2019

In order to use the Payment Services, as defined in the Payment Terms of Terms of Use agreement, you (“you” and “your”) must pre-authorize TNX Inc., owner of RALY brand, and subsidiaries (collectively and individually according to context, “RALY”) to debit your bank account as described in the Payment Terms. This Pre-Authorized Debit Agreement (this “Authorization”) constitutes your agreement and authorization for RALY to debit your bank account as described in the Payments Terms and is effective as of the date you accept the Payment Terms.

You acknowledge that this Authorization is provided for the benefit of RALY and your financial institution (“Financial Institution”) and is provided in consideration of your Financial Institution agreeing to process all debits against your bank account(s) (the “Settlement Account”) in accordance with the Rules of the Payments Canada.

You hereby authorize RALY to draw on the Settlement Account for purposes of (a) funding a reserve account to secure the performance of your payment obligations pursuant to the Payment Terms, (b) processing refunds or transaction reversals or chargebacks, or (c) collecting any and all amounts owed to RALY under the Payment Terms or any other agreement between you and RALY (a “debit” or “PAD”). In particular, you agree that if any payment is dishonored by your Financial Institution for any reason, RALY shall be entitled to issue another debit in substitution for the dishonored debit. RALY shall be under no liability whatsoever caused by a dishonored debit.

You may cancel this Authorization at any time by closing your RALY Account. You acknowledge that, if you revoke this Authorization, you must close your RALY Account or else RALY may do so. RALY may debit the Settlement Account up until 30 days after your cancellation or revocation.

You acknowledge that your Financial Institution is not required to verify that (a) a PAD has been issued in accordance with the particulars of this Authorization or (b) any purpose of payment for which the PAD has been issued has been fulfilled by RALY as a condition to honoring a PAD issued on your Settlement Account.
