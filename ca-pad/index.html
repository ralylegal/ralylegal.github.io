    <h1>Pre-Authorized Debit Agreement</h1>
    <h6>Canadian customers only</h6>

<p>Version: 1-2019 <br>Last updated Jan 20, 2018</p>

<p>In order to use the Payment Services, as defined in the Payment Terms of Terms of Use agreement, you (“you” and
    “your”) must pre-authorize TNX Inc., owner of RALY brand, and subsidiaries (collectively and individually according to
    context, “RALY”) to debit your bank account as described in the Payment Terms. This Pre-Authorized Debit Agreement (this
    “Authorization”) constitutes your agreement and authorization for RALY to debit your bank account as described in
    the Payments Terms and is effective as of the date you accept the Payment Terms.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that this Authorization is provided for the benefit of RALY and your financial institution
    (“Financial Institution”) and is provided in consideration of your Financial Institution agreeing to process all debits against
    your bank account(s) (the “Settlement Account”) in accordance with the Rules of the Payments Canada.</p>
<p>You hereby authorize RALY to draw on the Settlement Account for purposes of (a) funding a reserve account to secure
    the performance of your payment obligations pursuant to the Payment Terms, (b) processing refunds or transaction
    reversals or chargebacks, or (c) collecting any and all amounts owed to RALY under the Payment Terms or any other agreement
    between you and RALY (a “debit” or “PAD”). In particular, you agree that if any payment is dishonored by your
    Financial Institution for any reason, RALY shall be entitled to issue another debit in substitution for the dishonored debit.
    RALY shall be under no liability whatsoever caused by a dishonored debit.</p>
<p>You may cancel this Authorization at any time by closing your RALY Account. You acknowledge that, if you revoke this
    Authorization, you must close your RALY Account or else RALY may do so. RALY may debit the Settlement Account up
    until 30 days after your cancellation or revocation.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that your agreement to this Authorization with RALY constitutes delivery of this Authorization by
    you to RALY and your Financial Institution.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that the debits authorized pursuant to this Authorization are for business purposes.</p>
<p>The details of the Settlement Account that RALY is authorized to draw upon are set out in your RALY Account. You may
    only change the Settlement Account that RALY is authorized to draw upon by updating the details of the Settlement
    Account in your RALY Account.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that your Financial Institution is not required to verify that (a) a PAD has been issued in
    accordance with the particulars of this Authorization or (b) any purpose of payment for which the PAD has been issued has been
    fulfilled by RALY as a condition to honoring a PAD issued on your Settlement Account.</p>
<p>Even if you cancel or revoke this Authorization, certain provisions of the Payment Terms between you and RALY
    survive and remain in effect in accordance with their terms. To obtain a sample cancellation form, or for more information
    on your right to cancel a PAD Agreement, you may contact your Financial Institution or visit https://www.payments.ca.
    You have certain recourse rights if any debit does not comply with this Authorization. For example, you have the
    right to receive reimbursement for any debit that is not authorized or is not consistent with this Authorization. To
    obtain more information on your recourse rights, contact your Financial Institution or visit https://www.payments.ca.
    A PAD may be disputed by you only if (a) the PAD was not drawn in accordance with this Authorization or (b) amounts
    were drawn after this Authorization was revoked. In order to be reimbursed, you acknowledge that a declaration must
    be completed and presented to your Financial Institution holding the Settlement Account up to and including 10
    business days after the date on which the PAD in dispute was posted to the Settlement Account. You acknowledge that, after
    such 10 business day period, a claim that the Authorization was revoked or any other dispute of a PAD is a matter to be
    resolved solely between you and RALY.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that you understand the terms hereof and you accept and agree to participate in this PAD arrangement
    with RALY.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that RALY may assign this Authorization, whether directly or indirectly, by operation of law, change
    of control, or otherwise, by providing at least 10 days prior written notice to you.</p>
<p>You understand that you can contact RALY by email: support@raly.com or Telephone: 1-800- 316-3070 to make any
    inquiries, obtain information or seek any recourse rights with respect to this PAD arrangement.</p>
<p>You consent to the disclosure of any personal information that may be contained in this Authorization to financial
    institutions at which RALY maintains its account to be credited with the PADs as far as any such disclosure of
    personal information is directly related to and necessary for the proper application of the Rules of the Canadian Payments
    Association.</p>
<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THE FOREGOING TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND, IN PARTICULAR, YOU HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO
    RECEIVE ANY NOTICE FROM RALY OF THE AMOUNT TO BE DEBITED AGAINST THE SETTLEMENT ACCOUNT AND THE DATES ON WHICH THE
    DEBITS WILL BE PROCESSED, AS WELL AS NOTICE OF ANY AND ALL FUTURE CHANGES TO THE AMOUNTS OR PAYMENT DATES.
    The parties have requested that this Authorization and all related documents be drawn up in English only. Les
    parties aux présentes ont exigé que le présent contrat et tous les documents qui s’y rattachent soient rédigés en anglais
    seulement.</p>
