                method. Please keep your payment method information current (i.e. credit card number and expiration
                date). If this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources
                available to us without any action on your part. If you do not want us to update your card information,

            <p>Raly uses a multiple currency system whereby international banks are used to store funds. In Canada and
                USA, Raly uses Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#x201C;CDIC&#x201D;) or Federal Deposit Insurance
                Corporation (&quot;FDIC&quot;) insured bank accounts to manage its funds. Any Raly balance you hold
                inside Raly&apos;s virtual digital wallets, represents an unsecured claim against Raly and is not
                directly insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#x201C;CDIC&#x201D;) or Federal Deposit
                Insurance Corporation (&quot;FDIC&quot;) by any other provincial or state insurer of deposits. Raly
                reserves the right to invest the funds in liquid or low risk investments. Raly owns the interest or
                other earnings on these investments. These pooled amounts are considered separate from Raly&#x2019;s
                corporate funds, and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
                bankruptcy.</p>
            <h3>Wallet and Balance</h3>

            <p>In Raly funds are held in virtual digital wallets, hereafter referred to as &quot;wallet&quot;, are
                protected by cryptography whereby only those with access to both private and public cryptographic keys
                can manage the virtual funds. Spending or transfering the available balance of any wallet is
                reallocation of claim to funds managed by Raly and not reallocation of ownership. You may transfer any
                amount of funds within the systems limitations to other users or wallets or exchanged into any allowed
                and/or supported currencies. You may withdraw any portion of wallet balance to a linked bank account on
                the condition the bank account and your identity is verified 10 business days prior to withdrawal
                action. If we have not verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you
                cannot withdraw money to your bank account. You may not be able to withdraw funds from wallets to a
                credit-card due to limitation or restriction by credit-card providers and third-part payment gateways.</p>
            <p>Bank transfers for both depositing funds into wallet or withdrawing from wallet into a bank account may
                take several days or weeks depending on the bank and local banking system.</p>
            <p>Raly offers several different wallet types with different system wide functionalities:<br>
                . Cash wallet<br>
                . Debit wallet<br>
                . other wallet kinds</p>
            <p>Raly reserves the right to add or remove wallet types or change the fees, systematics or functionalities
                of all wallet types.</p>
            <p>Cash and Debit wallets are generated automatically for each profile the user account owns. The
                difference between Cash and Debit wallets are primarliy based on fees which can be found on Fees Page.</p>

                account activity and the activity of users with whom you&#x2019;ve transacted comply with this
                agreement. In connection with our review process, you may be required to provide us with additional
                information and/or documentation to verify your identity. We may limit your account and your access to
                money in it or that is sent to you until verification is completed.</p>
            <p>Reviews may result in:</p>
            <p>. delayed, blocked or cancelled transfers;<br>
                . money or payments being held by us;<br>
                . money or payments being applied to amounts you owe to us or used to offset loss incurred by us;<br>
                . account limitation, suspension or termination;<br>
                . money or payments being seized to comply with a court order, warrant or other legal process; and/or<br>
                . money or payments you previously received being reversed (i.e., sent back to the sender or to the
                card or bank account that was used to fund the payment).</p>
            <p>Among other reasons, we may take the above actions if you knowingly or unknowingly were a participant in
                a payment that was made from a stolen card, compromised bank account, or compromised Raly account, or
                if you were a participant in a transaction for goods and services between two personal accounts.</p>
            <p>RALY SHOULD ONLY BE USED TO TRANSACT WITH PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND TRUST. DO NOT USE RALY TO TRANSACT WITH
                PEOPLE YOU DON&#x2019;T KNOW, ESPECIALLY IF THE PAYMENT INVOLVES THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF A GOOD OR
                SERVICE. IF YOU USE RALY TO CONDUCT A TRANSACTION AND WE LATER REVERSE THE PAYMENT (WHICH COULD OCCUR
                IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS VIOLATED OR IF THE PAYMENT WAS MADE USING A COMPROMISED
                PAYMENT METHOD OR ACCOUNT), YOU COULD LOSE BOTH THE UNDERLYING GOODS OR SERVICES AND THE MONEY SENT FOR
                THEM.</p>
            <h3>Fees</h3>

            <p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and/or the number of payments you can send and
                receive. You can view any sending limit on our Payment Limits page.</p>
            <p>The fees applicable to sending money can be found on the Fees page. If you use your credit-card as the
                payment method when sending money, you may also be charged a cash-advance fee by your card issuer.</p>
            <p>In order to manage risk, we may limit the payment methods available when you make a payment.</p>
            <p>Fees and limits may change from time to time in our sole discretion.</p>
            <h3>Payment and Transfer Reviews</h3>

            <p>When we identify a potentially high-risk payment, we review the transaction more closely before allowing
                it to proceed. When this happens, we will place a hold on the transaction and notify the other party to
                delay delivery of the item or service. As a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item or services
                you purchased. If we clear the transaction, we will notify the parties involved and if we don&#x2019;t
                clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the money to you, unless we are legally required to
                take other action.</p>
            <h3>Refunds</h3>

            <p>When you make a payment transaction using Raly and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money
                will be sent back to the sending party. Money may not always be refunded to the payment method
                originally used and instead made available in your default Raly wallet.</p>
            <h3>Criminal activity</h3>

            <p>Any criminal activity, suspicious actions and attempt in illegal actions such as money laundering,
                purchase or sale of illegal drugs, narcotics and guns may result in closure of account and loss of
                funds.</p>
            <h3>Sharing Wallets</h3>

            <h3>Sharing Transactions</h3>

                an appeal of the decision with us if you have new or compelling information not available at the time
                of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.</p>

                of your claim. The Raly Protected Purchase program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return

                receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that we specify. You must respond
                to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.</p>
            <p>Step 3: Comply with our shipping requests in a timely manner, if you&#x2019;re filing a Significantly
                Not as Described claim, we may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to us
                or to a third party (which we will specify) and to provide proof of delivery.</p>
            <p>Proof of delivery means:</p>
            <p>For transactions that total less than $500 U.S. dollars, confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/state or zip
                                    code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.
                                    For transactions that total $500
                U.S. dollars or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery.<br>
                Step 4: We will make a decision (including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in our sole
                discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional
                information provided during the dispute resolution process or any other information we deem relevant
                and appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
            <p>Dispute with us or your card issuer<br>
                If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your Raly account
                and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your
                card issuer. Applicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under the
                Raly terms. For example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover
                amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don&#x2019;t qualify for protection under a
                claim with us.</p>
            <p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with us under the Raly protection, or to pursue the dispute
                with your card issuer. You can&#x2019;t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery. If you
                pursue a dispute/claim with us under the Raly terms and you also pursue a dispute for the same
                transaction with your card issuer, we&#x2019;ll close your dispute/claim with us. This won&#x2019;t
                affect the dispute process with your card issuer. In addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card
                issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim under the Raly Protected Purchase program with us later.</p>
            <p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with us under the Raly terms and we decide against you, you can
                seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later. If we do not make a final decision on your
                claim until after your card issuer&apos;s deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you
                recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will
                reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the
                seller or your card issuer).</p>
            <p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with us under the Raly Protected Purchase
                program, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the
                seller&#x2019;s return policy.</p>
            <h3>Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks</h3>

            <h4>Payments that are invalidated and
                reversed</h4>

            <p>Payments may be invalidated and reversed by us if, among other reasons, Raly sent the payment to you in
                error, the funding transaction is declined or reversed, the payment was unauthorized or unfunded, or if
                the payment was for activities that violated this user agreement or any other agreement with us.</p>
            <p>As the sender or recipient of a payment that is later invalidated for any reason, you may be liable to
                us for the full amount of the payment and we may recover the amount of the payment (plus any fees) from
                you. We may recover the amount of the payment from either the sender or the recipient of an invalidated
                payment in our discretion (subject to applicable law). For example, if you send a payment funded by a
                bank account and the bank informs us it cannot cover the payment due to a lack of funds or a dispute,
                we may hold you liable for the payment, or if you were the recipient of that payment, we may reverse
                that payment from your account to cover the liability.</p>
            <p>When recovering the amount of an invalidated payment from you, we may apply any money sent to you on
                Raly, request that you add money to your account for the amount of the payment and apply that money to
                amounts owed, and/or we may:</p>
            <p>. engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you;<br>
                . take any or all action as outlined under Amounts Owed to Us; and<br>
                . place a limitation or take other action on your Raly account as outlined under Restricted Activities
                and Holds and Limitations.</p>
            <p>If we invalidate a payment because the card issuer or originating bank declined or reversed the
                transaction, then you may be liable for the payment even if you disagree with the decision of the card
                issuer or originating bank to decline or reverse the payment. If you believe that a payment initiated
                with your Raly account was not authorized, then you must notify us immediately, even if you (or someone
                else) disputes the transaction with the card issuer or originating bank. Please see below under the
                heading Reporting an Unauthorized Transaction for information about how to notify us. If you fail to
                report the unauthorized activity directly to us, then we may recover the amount of the reversed payment
                from you, as described above.</p>

            <p>Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities<br>
                If we believe that you&#x2019;ve engaged in any of these activities, we may take a number of actions to
                protect ourselves, our customers and others at any time in our sole discretion. The actions we make
                take include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
            <p>. Terminate this user agreement, limit your Raly and/or Raly account, and/or close or suspend your Raly
                and/or Raly account, including cancelling your Raly Mastercard (if any), immediately and without

                payment methods linked to your Raly or Raly account, restricting your ability to send money or make
                bank transfers;<br>
                . Hold your Raly balance for up to 180 days if reasonably needed to protect against the risk of
                liability or if you have violated our Acceptable Use Policy;<br>
                . Suspend your eligibility for the Raly Protected Purchase program and/or Raly&#x2019;s Purchase
                Protection program;<br>
                . Update inaccurate information you provided us;<br>
                . Take legal action against you; or<br>
                . If you&#x2019;ve violated our Acceptable Use Policy, then you&#x2019;re also responsible for damages
                to us caused by your violation of this policy.</p>
            <p>If we close your Raly account or terminate your use of the Raly services for any reason, we&#x2019;ll
                provide you with notice of our actions and make any unrestricted money held in your Raly account or

            <p>You are responsible for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability

                agreement, and/or your use of the Raly services. For example, if you send a payment funded by your bank
                account and your bank informs us you do not have sufficient funds to cover the payment, you may be
                liable for the payment. Similarly, if you receive a payment and the payment is disputed, you may be
                liable for the payment.</p>
            <h3>Holds and Limitations</h3>

            <h4>What are holds and limitations</h4>

            <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect Raly and the security and integrity of the network that
                uses the Raly services, Raly may, in its sole discretion, take account-level or transaction-level
                actions.</p>
            <p>Our decision about holds and limitations may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our
                management of risk and the protection of Raly, our customers and/or service providers. We may use
                proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your Raly account. In
                addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain
                information to you about such decisions. We have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk
                management or security procedures to you.</p>
            <h4>Holds</h4>

            <p>A hold is an action that Raly may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or
                the account level. When Raly places a temporary hold on a transaction, the money is not available to
                either the sender or the recipient. Raly reviews many factors before placing a hold on a transaction,
                including: account tenure, transaction activity, and past disputes.</p>
            <h4">Holds based on Raly&#x2019;s risk
                decisions</h4>

            <p>We may place a hold on transactions involving your Raly account if, in our sole discretion, we believe
                that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your Raly account, or your transactions or
                that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements. We make
                decisions about whether to place a hold based on a number of factors, including information available
                to us from both internal sources and third parties.</p>
            <p>Risk-based holds may remain in place for up to 180 days from the date the transaction was made. We may
                release the hold earlier under certain circumstances, but any earlier release is at our sole
                discretion.</p>
            <h4>Account Limitations</h4>

            <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect Raly and Raly users when we notice restricted activities or
                activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious. Limitations also help us collect information
                necessary for keeping your Raly account open.</p>
            <p>There are several reasons why your Raly account could be limited, including:</p>
            <p>. If we suspect someone could be using your Raly account without your knowledge, we&#x2019;ll limit it
                for your protection and look into the unusual activity.<br>
                . If another financial institution alerts us that someone has used one of your linked payment methods
                without permission.<br>
                . In order to comply with the law.<br>
                . If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.</p>
            <p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed. Normally, this
                is done after you provide us with the information we request. However, if we reasonably believe a risk
                still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect us, our users,
                a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any
                other liability.</p>
            <h4>Court Orders,
                Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process</h4>

            <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent
                process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with
                applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including
                holding payments to/from your Raly account, placing a hold or limitation on your Raly account, or
                releasing your funds. We will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us. We do not
                have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your Raly
                account. When we implement a hold or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law,
                regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold or limitation may remain in place longer than
                180 days.</p>
            <h4>Protection from Unauthorized
                Transactions</h4>

            <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your Raly account, you should regularly log into your
                Raly account and review your Raly account statement. We will notify you of each transaction by sending
                an email to your primary email address on file and/or creating a story in your feed, depending on your
                preferences. You should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was
                authorized and accurately completed.</p>
            <p>We will protect you from unauthorized activity in your Raly account. The following terms and conditions
                apply with respect to all Raly services, other than those associated with the Raly Mastercard. For
                resolution procedures for unauthorized transactions and other errors associated with your use of the
                Raly Mastercard, please see the Raly Mastercard Cardholder Agreement. When the below protection
                applies, we will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate
                with us and follow the procedures described below.</p>
            <h4>What is an Unauthorized Transaction</h4>

            <p>An &#x201C;Unauthorized Transaction&#x201D; occurs when money is sent from your Raly account that you
                did not authorize and that did not benefit you. For example, if someone steals your password, uses the
                password to access your Raly account, and sends a payment from your Raly account, an Unauthorized
                Transaction has occurred.</p>
            <h4>What is not considered an
                Unauthorized Transaction</h4>

            <p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:</p>
            <p>. If you give someone access to your Raly account (by giving them your phone or login information) and
                they use your Raly account without your knowledge or permission. You are responsible for transactions
                made in this situation.<br>
                . Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals
                and Chargebacks.<br>
                Reporting an Unauthorized Transaction</p>
            <p>If you believe your Raly login information has been lost or stolen, please contact Raly customer service
                immediately.</p>
            <p>Tell us AT ONCE if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission
                using your login information or by other means, or if your Raly-activated mobile phone has been lost,
                stolen, or deactivated. You could lose all the money in your Raly account. If you tell us within 60
                days after we provide you your Raly account statement showing transfers you did not make, you will be
                eligible for 100% protection for Unauthorized Transactions.</p>
            <p>Also, if your Raly account statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made with
                your Raly login information or by other means, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days
                after we provided the statement to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we
                can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time. If a
                good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time
                periods.</p>
            <p>Filing a chargeback or reversal with your financial institution related to a Raly payment does not
                constitute notice of an Unauthorized Transaction to us. You must contact us directly to notify us of
                Unauthorized Transactions by reaching out to Raly customer service.</p>

            <p>An &#x201C;error&#x201D; means the following:</p>
            <p>. When money is either incorrectly taken from your Raly account or incorrectly placed into your Raly
                account, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your Raly account.<br>

                . We make a computational or mathematical error related to your Raly account.</p>
            <h4>What is not considered an error</h4>

            <p>The following are NOT considered errors:</p>
            <p>. If you give someone access to your Raly account (by giving them your login information) and they use
                your Raly account without your knowledge or permission. You are responsible for transactions made in
                this situation.<br>
                . Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals

                information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt. We must hear from you no later than 60
                days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared. Filing a chargeback or

            <p>We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will
                correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate
                your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will provisionally credit your Raly account
                within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error and will notify you within 2 Business Days
                of the credit, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our
                investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it

                If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation, and, if you received a
                provisional credit, after giving you 5 Business Days advance notice of the date and amount of the
                debit, we will remove it from your account. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our
                investigation.</p>
            <h4>Processing Errors</h4>

            <p>We will rectify any processing error that we discover. If the error results in:</p>

            <h3>Disclaimer of Warranty and Release</h3>

            <h4>No warranty</h4>

            <p>The Raly services are provided &#x201C;as-is&#x201D; and without any representation or warranty, whether
                express, implied or statutory. We specifically disclaim any implied warranties of title,
                merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</p>
            <p>We do not have any control over the products or services provided by sellers who accept Raly as a
                payment method, and we cannot ensure that a Raly user or a seller you are dealing with will actually
                complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or
                secure access to any part of the Raly services, and operation of our websites, software, or systems
                (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Raly services) operated by us or on our
                behalf may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. We will make reasonable
                efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, debit cards,
                credit cards, and check issuances are processed in a timely manner but we make no representations or
                warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the Raly services are
                dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or the U.S. or
                international mail service. Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the
                foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.</p>
            <h4>Your Release of Us</h4>

            <p>If you have a dispute with any other Raly account holder, you release us from any and all claims,
                demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out
                of or in any way connected with such disputes. In entering into this release you expressly waive any
                protections (whether statutory or otherwise, for example, California Civil Code &#xA7; 1542) that would
                otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect
                to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</p>
            <h4>Agreement to Arbitrate</h4>

            <p>ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS USER AGREEMENT MUST BE ASSERTED
                INDIVIDUALLY IN BINDING ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR WITH EXPERIENCE IN CONSUMER ONLINE
                PAYMENT SERVICES DISPUTES ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (&#x201C;AAA&#x201D;) IN
                ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE AAA SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR
                CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES. The forum for arbitration shall be in the city closest to your residence
                having a federal district courthouse. The arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class or collective
                arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals. To the extent allowed by applicable
                law, the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive
                authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
                formation of this user agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this
                user agreement is void or voidable. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in
                any court of competent jurisdiction. For any non-frivolous claim, Raly will pay the costs of the
                arbitration (but not your attorney fees), up to $3,000.</p>
            <p>This user agreement and each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the
                United States Arbitration Act shall apply in all cases and govern the interpretation and enforcement of
                the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings. There are only two exceptions to this agreement to
                arbitrate. First, if we reasonably believe that you have in any manner violated or threatened to
                violate our intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any
                court of competent jurisdiction. Second, any claim of $500 or less may, at the option of the claiming
                party, be resolved in small claims court in New York City, New York, if the claim and the parties are
                within the jurisdiction of the small claims court. For these two exceptions, you agree to submit to the

            <h4>Consumer fraud warning</h4>

            <p>We&#x2019;re always looking for ways to help keep you even more secure. So stay on the lookout for some
                of these common scams:</p>
            <p>Seller Scam: a scammer sends you a fraudulent payment for goods or services you provide outside of Raly.<br>
                Accidental Payment: a scammer sends you a fraudulent payment, claims it was accidental, and asks that
                you return their money.<br>
                Always use common sense when sending money. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
                Only send money for yourself and not for others. Remember that if you don&#x2019;t make a purchase from
                an authorized merchant or with your Raly Mastercard, you&#x2019;re not covered by Raly Protected
                Purchase Program. Please let us know immediately if you believe someone is trying to scam or defraud
                you by contacting us.</p>
            <h4>Dormant accounts</h4>

            <p>If you do not log in to your Raly account for two or more years, we may close your Raly account and send
                any of your funds held in our possession to your primary address (if we have verified the required
                identifying information that you have provided to us) or, if required, escheat (send) any of your funds
                held in our possession to your state of residency. We will determine your state of residency based on
                the information provided for your Raly account. If your address is unknown, any of your funds held in
                our possession will be escheated to the State of Delaware. Where required, we will send you a notice
                prior to escheating any of your funds. If you fail to respond to this notice, your funds held in our
                possession will be escheated to the applicable state. If you would like to claim any escheated funds
                from the applicable state, please contact the applicable state&#x2019;s unclaimed property
                administrator.</p>
